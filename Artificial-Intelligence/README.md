Consists of Machine Learning workflows, with examples showing various steps in a conventional machine learning pipeline (data-preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, model inference etc).

Lung Segmentation
=================
We implement a workflow that employs supervised learning techniques to locate lungs on X-ray images. Lung instance segmentation workflow uses Chest X-ray images for predicting lung masks from the images using U-Net model.

Mask Detection
==============
The workflow addresses the problem of determining what percentage of the population is properly wearing masks to better track our collective efforts in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in public spaces. It uses the FastRCNNPredictor deep learning model to detect masks on faces.

Orca Sound
==========
This workflow processes and analyzes the hydrophone data of sensors from **three locations** in the state of **Washington**, and uses trained machine learning models to automatically identify the whistles of the Orcas.
